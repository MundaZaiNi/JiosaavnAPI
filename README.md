## Project Discontinuation Notice

This unofficial Jio Saavn API project is being discontinued and the repository will be archived.

Reason for discontinuation:

- Potential conflict with Jio Saavn's terms of service

Recommendations:

1. Users are advised to explore official channels for accessing Jio Saavn data.
2. Consider alternative music streaming APIs that offer official developer support.

I appreciate the community's interest and contributions to this project. Thank you for your understanding.

Note: This repository will remain available in read-only mode for reference purposes.
